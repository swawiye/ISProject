                            Hospital-based organ donation and transplant coordination have been a complicated and delicate process.
                            In Kenya, the organ donation matching process is unreliable. It is characterized by disproportionate
                            data handling and inefficient decision making. Consequently, patients in desperate need of organ
                            transplants are forced to wait for extended periods of time for a suitable organ donation, resulting in death.
                            Medical practitioners are also impacted by the systematic inefficiency.<br />
                            The process of obtaining organs from donors and matching of donors with suitable recipients difficult.
                            This can be attributed to a number of factors, one of them being reliance on manual matching systems.

                            and cooperation between the parties involved in the organ donation process.
